Employee Review Analysis Framework is a website designed for job seekers/switchers to compare companies on 11 Cultural Parameters using Morris.JS Bar Charts based on Cultural Fit. Also one can classify Glassdoor Reviews (pros/cons) using a Machine Learning Algorithm - Support Vector Machine (SVM) that classifies reviews into either of  the 11 Cultural Parameters and generates accuracy for the same. End users can view  parameter ratings, check review and classify reviews and thus determine Person - Organization Fit using Textual Analytics.
